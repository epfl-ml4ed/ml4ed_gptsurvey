    "pagewelcome_intro": "Dear students,\n\nWe invite you to participate in our study.\n\nThe survey will take about 20 minutes and will involve you checking your feedback on the lectures assignments and answering simple scientific questions about the feedback. The goal of the study is to evaluate new forms of study materials for students. Your answers and user data will be kept confidential and used for research purposes only. Participants will be entered into a draw for five vouchers (5 x 20 CHF) for the Satellite bar.\n\nDuring the course of the study, some questions may seem redundant. Please answer these as thoroughly as possible, as they contribute to scientific knowledge. However, there are no right or wrong answers. It is best to follow your first impression - this is usually the best.\n\nBefore you agree to participate, the person in charge of the research project must explain the research project to you.\n\nProject Number: HREC 017-2023\n\nPrincipal Investigator of the project: Tanja Käser\n\nIf you have any questions about the participant information sheet or the consent form, please ask the researchers before you decide to participate. Here (information sheet), you can find more information about the study.\n\nThank you for your participation in this study! Feel free to contact us if you have any questions or concerns: tanya.nazaretsky@epfl.ch\n\nBest regards,\n\nDr. Tanya Nazaretsky, tanya.nazaretsky@epfl.ch\nPaola Mejia Domenzain, paola.mejia@epfl.ch\nVinitra Swamy, vinitra.swamy@epfl.ch\nProf. Dr. Tanja Käser, tanja.kaeser@epfl.ch",
