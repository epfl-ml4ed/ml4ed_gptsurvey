The feedback aims to assist you in improving your learning results.\n\nFor this reason, we created two variants of personalized feedback for you. In this survey, we ask you to compare them and express your opinion about their effectiveness and usefulness. Your answers will help us explore the best pedagogical approach for delivering future feedback for you.\n\nThe survey will take approximately 10 minutes of your time. Your answers and user data will be kept confidential and used for research purposes only. Participation in the study is voluntary, and you will receive one of the feedback variants even if you decide not to participate.\n\nIf you have any questions about the participant information sheet or the consent form, please ask the researchers before you decide to participate.
